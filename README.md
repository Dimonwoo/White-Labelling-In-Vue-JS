# White-Labelling-In-Vue-JS

White labeling in Vue.js refers to the process of customizing and branding a Vue.js application so that it can be easily rebranded and resold by different businesses or partners under their own brand identity. This is typically achieved by allowing users to modify aspects of the application's appearance, such as logos, color schemes, and other branding elements, to align with their unique brand identity. Vue.js, with its component-based architecture and flexibility, provides a robust framework for implementing white-label solutions, enabling businesses to offer a consistent user experience while adapting the application's visual elements to match their brand.

Notes:
Inorder to switch between different organizations you can change the folder directory (VUE_APP_DIRECTORY)(Eg:Try org1 or org 2 and try a npm run serve)  in the base .env.development.local or .env.production.local file.
